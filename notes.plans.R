# question posed
    # what are the costs of top products?  They use a little bit of this and little bit of this like sugar

# what do I want them to be able to do with it?

    #1 understand how profitable a particular product is in an absolute sense
    #2 know how far from mean the profitability of a certain product is
    #3 know the gross margin of all the products based on product mix sold
    #4 know how much the products made from a bag of sugar would sell for and therefore the mark up on that bag of sugar

#vision for the reports and products

#1 R Markdown report that itemizes the costs for each product, and shows a margin for each one
    # maybe blues for ingredients and reds for phases in stacked bar graph and sides by side too

#2 Sankey diagram starting with the ingredients and showing where each one goes

#3 Maybe a Shiny app that runs off of a Google Doc Christine has with sales or other database connection to lightspeed (POS)



# Data processing process

      #1 capture ingredients in google sheets in format as written in a recipe book (cups, oz, and time)
      #2 capture pricing of ingredients in units as written (lbs, kg)
      #3 convert all into grams, mL, or units
      #4 convert ingredients and labor phases into $
      #5 visualize costs and components of final products
      
      #6 capture basic sales data 
      #7 develop a Sankey chart that shows how much of each ingredient goes to which products
